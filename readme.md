Scallop is a language based on DataLog that supports differentiable logical and relational reasoning.
Scallop program can be easily integrated in Python and even with a PyTorch learning module. You can also use it as another DataLog solver.
Internally, Scallop is built on a generalized [Provenance Semiring](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=db_research) framework.
It allows arbitrary semirings to be configured, supporting Scallop to perform discrete logical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and differentiable reasoning.

This repository contains the Dockerfile for building the latest [Scallop Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvelingker/scallop).
